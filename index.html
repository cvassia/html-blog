        Our solar system is planetary system that orbits a star and all of the
        objects that travel around it—eight planets, dozens of moons and
        millions of asteroids, comets and meteoroids. The planetary system we
        call home is located in an outer spiral arm of the vast Milky Way
        galaxy. It consists of the Sun (our star) and everything that orbits
        around it. This includes the eight planets and their natural satellites
        (such as our moon), dwarf planets and their satellites, as well as
        asteroids, comets and countless particles of smaller debris.

      <h4>Formation</h4>
      <p>
        Our solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago from a dense cloud
        of interstellar gas and dust. The cloud collapsed, possibly due to the
        shockwave of a nearby exploding star, called a supernova. When this dust
        cloud collapsed, it formed a solar nebula—a spinning, swirling disk of
        material. At the center, gravity pulled more and more material in.
        Eventually the pressure in the core was so great that hydrogen atoms
        began to combine and form helium, releasing a tremendous amount of
        energy. With that, our Sun was born, and it eventually amassed more than
        99 percent of the available matter. Matter farther out in the disk was
        also clumping together. These clumps smashed into one another, forming
        larger and larger objects. Some of them grew big enough for their
        gravity to shape them into spheres, becoming planets, dwarf planets and
        large moons. In other cases, planets did not form: the asteroid belt is
        made of bits and pieces of the early solar system that could never quite
        come together into a planet. Other smaller leftover pieces became
        asteroids, comets, meteoroids, and small, irregular moons.
      </p>
      <h4>Structure</h4>
      <p>
        The order and arrangement of the planets and other bodies in our solar
        system is due to the way the solar system formed. Nearest the Sun, only
        rocky material could withstand the heat when the solar system was young.
        For this reason, the first four planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth and
        Mars—are terrestrial planets. They're small with solid, rocky surfaces.
        Meanwhile, materials we are used to seeing as ice, liquid or gas settled
        in the outer regions of the young solar system. Gravity pulled these
        materials together, and that is where we find gas giants Jupiter and
        Saturn and ice giants Uranus and Neptune.

      <p>
        From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times
        as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as
        much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury
        is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs to
        nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere.

      <p>
        Second planet from the Sun and our closest planetary neighbor, Venus is
        similar in structure and size to Earth, but it is now a very different
        world. Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction most planets do. Its
        thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it
        the hottest planet in our solar system—with surface temperatures hot
        enough to melt lead. Glimpses below the clouds reveal volcanoes and
        deformed mountains.
